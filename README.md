## Getting started

### Installation

To install directly from github try: `pip install git+https://github.com/samthiele/curlew.git`.

This should run on most systems: `numpy`, `pytorch` and `tqdm` are the only required dependencies. Matplotlib is handy too, but not required. 

### Tutorials

To help get up to speed with `curlew`, we maintain a set of CoLab tutorial notebooks [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14OPpL2-zKuJSd2Hh7jobnIYPnxzl0wCI?usp=sharing). 
Additional examples (used to make figures in the paper listed below) can be found [here](https://github.com/k4m4th/curlew_tutorials).
